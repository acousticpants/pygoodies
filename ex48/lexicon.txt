create lexicon of words for use in text based game

direction words: north, south, east, west, up, down, left, right, back
verbs: go, stop, kill, eat
stop words: the, in, of, from, at, it
nouns: door, bear, princess, cabinet
numbers: any str of 0 through 9 chars

use:
    stuff = raw_input("> ")
    words = stuff.split()

to break down commands

take each word and put into tuple pairs eg: (direction, north) (verb, go)

1st_word = 1st tuple
2nd_word = 2nd tuple

Write a scanner to take string of raw input and return sentence composed of tuples.
Also have an error category to print when user enters unrecognised words
